## Financial Metrics Glossary

### Income Statement

| Metric | Formula | What It Tells You |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Gross Profit | Revenue − COGS | Core product economics — can you make money at unit level? |
| Gross Margin % | Gross Profit / Revenue | Higher = more pricing power or lower unit costs |
| EBITDA | Earnings before interest, taxes, D&A | Operating cash generation, removes financing/accounting choices |
| EBITDA Margin | EBITDA / Revenue | Operational efficiency benchmark |
| Operating Income (EBIT) | EBITDA − D&A | After capital consumption |
| Net Income | EBIT − Interest − Taxes | Bottom line; affected by leverage and tax structure |
| EPS | Net Income / Diluted Shares | Per-share earnings; watch for dilution |

**Margin compression signals:** COGS growing faster than revenue; S&M costs rising without proportional revenue growth; G&A not scaling with growth.

### Balance Sheet

| Metric | Formula | Interpretation |
|--------|---------|----------------|
| Current Ratio | Current Assets / Current Liabilities | >1.5 healthy; <1.0 liquidity concern |
| Quick Ratio | (Cash + Receivables) / Current Liabilities | Excludes inventory; better liquidity test |
| D/E Ratio | Total Debt / Equity | Leverage; industry-dependent; >2x warrants scrutiny |
| Net Debt | Debt − Cash | True debt burden; negative = net cash position |
| Working Capital | Current Assets − Current Liabilities | Operational liquidity |

### Cash Flow

| Metric | Formula | What It Signals |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| Operating Cash Flow (OCF) | Net Income + D&A ± Working Capital changes | Cash actually generated by the business |
| FCF (Free Cash Flow) | OCF − CapEx | Cash available for debt, dividends, buybacks, acquisitions |
| FCF Margin | FCF / Revenue | Quality of earnings; high FCF margin = capital-light model |
| FCF Yield | FCF / Market Cap | Valuation metric; higher = cheaper |
| CapEx Intensity | CapEx / Revenue | Capital requirements of the business model |
| Cash Conversion | FCF / Net Income | >1.0 = earnings converting well; <0.5 = quality concern |

**Red flags:** OCF < Net Income (earnings not converting); CapEx spike without revenue growth; receivables growing faster than revenue (collection risk).

### Valuation Multiples

| Multiple | Formula | Typical Range (software) | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------------------------|-------|
| P/E | Price / EPS | 15–40x | Distorted by leverage and accounting |
| EV/EBITDA | Enterprise Value / EBITDA | 10–25x | Better for cross-company comparison |
| EV/Revenue | EV / Revenue | 3–15x | For pre-profit growth companies |
| P/FCF | Price / FCF | 20–50x | Best quality-of-earnings test |
| PEG | P/E / Growth Rate | <1 = potentially cheap | Growth-adjusted P/E |

## SaaS / Subscription Metrics

### Revenue Metrics

| Metric | Definition | Interpretation |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| MRR | Monthly Recurring Revenue | Core health metric; excludes one-time |
| ARR | MRR × 12 | Annualized run rate; not the same as annual revenue |
| NRR (Net Revenue Retention) | (MRR end − churned + expansion) / MRR start | >110% = customers spend more over time (best-in-class) |
| GRR (Gross Revenue Retention) | (MRR end − churned MRR) / MRR start | Excludes expansion; floor metric; best-in-class >90% |
| MRR Growth Rate | (MRR this month − MRR last month) / MRR last month | Compound this for ARR growth projection |

**NRR interpretation:**
- >130% = exceptional (Snowflake, Datadog tier)
- 110–130% = best-in-class growth SaaS
- 100–110% = healthy, some upsell
- <100% = customers shrinking over time → existential risk

### Customer Metrics

| Metric | Formula | Target |
|--------|---------|--------|
| CAC (Customer Acquisition Cost) | S&M Spend / New Customers | Lower is better; track trend |
| LTV (Lifetime Value) | ARPU × Gross Margin / Churn Rate | Higher is better |
| LTV/CAC | LTV / CAC | >3x healthy; >5x excellent; <1x broken model |
| CAC Payback | CAC / (ARPU × Gross Margin %) | <12 months excellent; <24 months acceptable |
| Logo Churn | Churned Customers / Total Customers | % customers lost; different from revenue churn |
| Revenue Churn | Churned MRR / Total MRR | More important than logo churn |

### Cohort Analysis Framework

Cohorts reveal what aggregate data hides:
- **By acquisition date:** Do newer cohorts retain better? → product improvement signal
- **By plan tier:** Do enterprise cohorts churn less? → segment economics
- **By channel:** Which acquisition source yields highest LTV?

Healthy cohort: revenue stays flat or grows in months 6–24.
Unhealthy cohort: revenue declines each month from day 1.

## Business Analysis Frameworks

### Profitability Decomposition (DuPont)

Net Margin × Asset Turnover × Equity Multiplier = Return on Equity (ROE)

Use this to diagnose ROE changes: is it margin, efficiency, or leverage?

### Unit Economics Framework

```
Revenue per unit
− Variable COGS per unit
= Gross Profit per unit
− Variable S&M per unit (allocated)
= Contribution Margin per unit
− Fixed cost allocation
= Unit Operating Profit
```

Viable business: Contribution Margin > 0 and improving.

### Waterfall / Bridge Analysis

Use to decompose changes between two periods:

```
Starting value
+ Volume effect   (more units sold at same price)
+ Price effect    (same units at higher price)
+ Mix effect      (shift toward higher-margin products)
+ FX effect       (if multi-currency)
= Ending value
```

### Growth Decomposition

Revenue growth = Volume growth + Price growth + Mix shift

Healthy: driven by volume and/or mix
Risky: driven entirely by price increases (demand destruction risk)

### MECE Issue Tree

For structuring analysis without gaps or overlaps:

```
Why is [metric] declining?
├── Market-level factors
│   ├── Market size shrinking?
│   └── Market share loss?
└── Company-level factors
    ├── Product competitiveness?
    ├── Go-to-market effectiveness?
    └── Pricing / packaging?
```

## Statistical Concepts for Analysts

### Correlation vs. Causation

Correlation (r): −1 to +1 — measures linear relationship strength.
- |r| > 0.7: strong; 0.4–0.7: moderate; < 0.4: weak
- **Never imply causation from correlation alone.** Always ask: confounding variable? reversed causation?

### Trend Decomposition (Time Series)

Any time series = Trend + Seasonality + Residual (noise)

Removing seasonality reveals true underlying growth.
Seasonality index: (month average) / (annual average). Values >1.0 = above-average month.

### Outlier Detection

- **Z-score**: >3 standard deviations from mean = statistical outlier
- **IQR method**: outside [Q1 − 1.5×IQR, Q3 + 1.5×IQR] = outlier
- **Business judgment always overrides statistics** — an outlier may be real (product launch, market event)

### Statistical Significance

p-value < 0.05: result unlikely to be random (95% confidence).
**Important:** statistically significant ≠ practically significant. A 0.1% improvement can be significant at large N but operationally irrelevant.

### Regression Analysis

Linear regression: Y = α + β₁X₁ + β₂X₂ + ε
- β (coefficient): how much Y changes per unit of X
- R²: % of variance explained (0.8+ = strong model fit)
- Use residuals plot to spot non-linearity or heteroskedasticity

### Forecasting Methods

| Method | Best For | Limitation |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| Linear trend | Steady growth | Ignores seasonality |
| Moving average | Smoothing noise | Lags real changes |
| Exponential smoothing | Recent trend weighting | Parameter sensitivity |
| ARIMA | Complex time series | Requires stationary data |
| Regression-based | Multi-variable drivers | Correlation ≠ causation |

## Chart Type Selection Guide

### By Analytical Purpose

| Question | Chart Type | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| How has X changed over time? | Line chart | Start Y-axis at 0 unless showing small variation |
| Which category is largest? | Bar chart (sorted descending) | Horizontal bars for long labels |
| What's the composition? | Stacked bar | 100% stacked for share; regular for absolute |
| How are two variables related? | Scatter plot | Add trend line; color by third variable |
| How are values distributed? | Histogram or box plot | Box plot for comparison across groups |
| What's the size of items in a whole? | Pie/donut (max 5 slices) | Only if exact proportions matter; label directly |
| How does value change step by step? | Waterfall chart | For decomposition of change |
| What's the geographic pattern? | Choropleth map | Use perceptually uniform color scale |
| How do multiple KPIs compare at a glance? | KPI cards | Large number + delta + trend sparkline |
| Flow between states | Sankey diagram | Customer journey, funnel transitions |

### Chart Antipatterns to Avoid

- **3D charts**: always misleading, never use
- **Pie with >5 slices**: unreadable; use bar instead
- **Dual Y-axis with different scales**: creates false correlation impression
- **Y-axis not starting at 0** (for bar charts): exaggerates differences
- **Gradient fill on bars**: suggests continuous data where there is none
- **Unlabeled axes**: always label with units

- Percentages in tables: align decimal points

### Conclusion Language (Use These Constructions)

- "X grew by Y% — driven primarily by Z"
- "Despite [positive], [negative] offsets the gain"
- "The gap between X and Y has widened to its largest point in N quarters"
- "At current trajectory, X will reach Y by [date]"
- "Three levers exist to improve this: [1], [2], [3]"
- "The data suggests — but cannot confirm — that [hypothesis]"
